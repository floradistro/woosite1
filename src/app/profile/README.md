# Profile Page Component Structure

## Overview
The profile page has been completely refactored from a monolithic 2016-line file into a clean, modular component architecture. This optimization improves maintainability, reusability, and developer experience.

## File Structure

```

```

## Component Responsibilities

### Core Components

**NavigationSidebar**
- Handles tab navigation and mobile/desktop responsiveness
- Contains search bar (desktop only) and user info header
- Manages active tab state and visual indicators

**UserInfoHeader**
- Displays user avatar with gradient background
- Shows user name and email
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Tab Content Components

**ProfileTabContent**
- Personal information editing (name, email, phone, address)
- Form validation and state management
- Edit/save/cancel functionality

**OrdersTabContent**
- Order history display with status indicators
- Expandable order details
- Mobile-optimized order cards

**PaymentMethodsTabContent**
- Payment card management with card icons
- Add/remove/set default functionality
- Secure card display with masked numbers

**RewardsTabContent**
- Points overview with tier progression
- Available rewards with redemption logic
- Referral code sharing with copy functionality
- Activity history with transaction icons

**SubscriptionsTabContent**
- Active subscription management
- Subscription overview statistics
- Pause/modify/cancel actions

**SettingsTabContent**
- Notification preferences with toggle switches
- Security settings navigation
- Account management options

### Shared Components

**ToggleSwitch**
- Reusable toggle component with smooth animations
- Consistent styling across the application
- Configurable on/off states

**LoadingStates**
- Multiple loading state components
- Consistent loading indicators
- Proper authentication flow handling

## Data Management

**useProfileData Hook**
- Centralized state management for all profile data
- Mock data for development and testing
- Action handlers for all profile operations
- Type-safe data structures

## TypeScript Types

All components use strongly typed interfaces including:
- `User`, `EditableProfile` - User data structures
- `PaymentMethod`, `NewCard` - Payment information
- `RewardsData`, `AvailableReward` - Rewards system
- `Subscription`, `Order` - E-commerce data
- `ToggleStates`, `TabType` - UI state management

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be used across different pages
3. **Testing**: Easier to unit test individual components
4. **Performance**: Better code splitting and loading
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear file structure and type safety
6. **Scalability**: Easy to add new tabs or features

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { 
  ProfileTabContent, 
  RewardsTabContent, 
  ToggleSwitch 
} from './components';

// Components are fully self-contained and type-safe
<ProfileTabContent user={user} isMobile={isMobile} />
<RewardsTabContent 
  isMobile={isMobile}
  rewardsData={rewardsData}
  availableRewards={availableRewards}
  rewardsHistory={rewardsHistory}
  onRewardRedeem={handleRewardRedeem}
/>
```

## Mobile Responsiveness

All components are designed with mobile-first approach:
- Responsive layouts with conditional rendering
- Touch-friendly interaction areas
- Optimized typography and spacing
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Future Enhancements

The modular structure makes it easy to:
- Add new profile tabs
- Implement real API integration
- Add component-level caching
- Enhance with additional features
- Create component variations for different user types
